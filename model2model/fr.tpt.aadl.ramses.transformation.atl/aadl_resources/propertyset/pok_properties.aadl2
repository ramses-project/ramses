property set POK is

  Security_Level : aadlinteger applies to
         (virtual processor, virtual bus, process, bus, event data port, event port, data port);
  -- Means two things :
  --   * security_level that a partition is allowed to access
  --   * security_level provided by a virtual bus : ensure that
  --     the virtual bus can transport data from and/or to partitions
  --     that have this security level.

  Criticality : aadlinteger applies to
         (virtual processor);
  --  Represent the criticality level of a partition.

  Handler : aadlstring applies to
         (virtual processor);
  -- Error handler for each partition
  -- By default, the code generator can create a function
  -- which name derives from the partition name. Instead, the
  -- model can provide the name of the handler with this property.

  Topics : list of aadlstring applies to
         (virtual processor, virtual bus);
  -- Means two things :
  --   * The topics allowed on a specific virtual processor
  --   * Topics allowed on a virtual bus.

  Needed_Memory_Size : Size applies to (process);
  -- Specify the amount of memory needed for a partition
  -- We apply it to process component because we don't
  -- isolate virtual processor, only processes

  Available_Schedulers : type enumeration (RMS, EDF, LLF, RR, TIMESLICE, STATIC);

  Timeslice : Time applies to (virtual processor);
  -- DEPRECATED at this time

  Scheduler : POK::Available_Schedulers
      applies to (processor, virtual processor);

  --  List available schedulers
  --  When we use the STATIC scheduler in the virtual processor
  --  The Slots and Slots_Allocation properties are used to determine when
  --  partitions are activated and the timeslice they have for their execution.

  Available_BSP : type enumeration
  (
      x86_qemu,
      prep,
      leon3
  );

  BSP : POK::Available_BSP applies to (processor, system);

  Available_Architectures : type enumeration
  (
      x86, ppc, sparc
  );

  Architecture : POK::Available_Architectures applies to (processor, system);

  -- Deployment properties
  -- Indicate which architecture we use and which bsp

  MILS_Verified : aadlboolean applies to (system, process, device, thread, processor, data);
  --  For verification purpose

  Refresh_Time : Time applies to (data port);

  Hw_Addr : aadlstring applies to (device);

  PCI_Vendor_Id : aadlstring applies to (device);

  PCI_Device_ID : aadlstring applies to (device);

  Device_Name : aadlstring applies to (device);

  Additional_Features : list of POK::Supported_Additional_Features applies to (virtual processor, processor);

  Supported_Additional_Features: type enumeration (libmath, libc_stdlib, libc_stdio, libc_string, io, pci, console, libc);

  Des_Key : aadlstring applies to (virtual bus);

  Des_Init : aadlstring applies to (virtual bus);

  Blowfish_Key : aadlstring applies to (virtual bus);

  Blowfish_Init : aadlstring applies to (virtual bus);

  Supported_POK_Protocols: type enumeration (ceasar,des,blowfish,unknown);

  Protocol : POK::Supported_POK_Protocols applies to (virtual bus);
  
  Supported_Ports_Flush_Time: type enumeration (Major_Frame_Switch, Minor_Frame_Switch, Partition_Slot_Switch);

  Ports_Flush_Time: POK::Supported_Ports_Flush_Time => Major_Frame_Switch applies to (processor);

  Module_Minor_Frame: Time applies to (processor);
end POK;
